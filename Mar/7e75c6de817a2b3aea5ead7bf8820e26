Elevated OPEX and FX losses pressure Full Year 2022 earnings. Lafarge Africa (WAPCO) in Full Year for 2022 audited results released show EPS growth to122.4% year on year in Q4 2022, however Full Year 2022 EPS grew by 5.2% year on year.  The company proposed a final dividend of N2.00/s, translating to a dividend yield of 7.3% based on the closing price of NGN27.40 (01 March).  According to the company’s report, earnings were driven by double-digit growth in price and sales volumes in Quarter 4 in 2022, offsetting elevated Selling and Distribution costs and Net finance cost. The achieved EPS is 16.2% above our forecasts for Full Year 2022.  The market’s reaction to the results has been bullish as the stock gained 5.38% post-release. Year-to-date, the stock is up 14.2%. Price and volume growth drive revenue  The report further disclosed that the company’s revenue grew by 39.9% year on year in Q4 2022, Full Year good at 27.3% year on year. Topline growth reflected across its product segments, Cement revenue up 27.0% year on year, Aggregates and concrete revenue soared to 43.4% year on year and Other products up by 1.70% year on year. The achieved revenue of the company is above analyst Full Year 2022 forecasts by 2.7% variance, owing to higher-than-anticipated price growth by 4.5% variance offsetting lower-than-expected volume growth of negative by 1.8% variance. The quarter saw price increases the average price per tonne rose by 26.4% year on year complement volumes by10.7% year on year to 1.43Mt. We are encouraged by the improved volume growth reflecting success in the company’s strategy to focus on driving capacity utilisation via debottlenecking exercises in its Ashaka and Ewekoro plants rather than investing in additional capacity. This also reflects demand recovery from Q3 2022 which was characterised by torrential rainfall and the flooding.  Nevertheless, for Full Year 2022, the company’s volumes were flat of negative by 0.1% year on year, while price per tonne grew 27.5% year on year. Like its peers, the company noted LNG supply disruptions and record high inflation impeded volume growth for Full Year 2022. Going Into 2023, we believe the company is positioned for growth as it ramps up output on the back of the de-bottlenecking exercise strategy, barring any significant climate or gas supply-related challenges.   EBITDA margin weathers elevated OPEX The company’s Gross margin expanded by 466bps to 59.4% in Q4 2022 as Cost of sales by 25.5% year on year grew slower than Revenue by39.9% year on year. However, the surge in Production costs by103.6% year on year), Fuel & Power  by 20.8% year on year and Raw materials & consumables by 32.3% year on year, driven by the worsening FX situation as it relates to key imported supplies and sustained hike in energy costs, pressured Cost of sales for Full Year 2022 which stood at 17.6% year on year. These were offset by the strong topline growth and consequently, Gross Profits were up 51.8% year on year in Q4 2022, Full Year stood at 37.6% year on year.  While a 43.8% year on year rise in Operating expenses pressured EBITDA margin by 364bps, EBITDA expanded by 26.0% year on year in Q4 2022 of Full Year 2022: 12.1% year on year. The culprit across the industry remained Selling and Distribution costs, up 57.2% year on year. The distribution cost component, accounting for 94% of total Selling & Distribution costs, surged by 59.3% as the sustained elevated cost of Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) in Nigeria remained a major headwind. Advertising expenses by 65.1% year on year also contributed to pressure OPEX, Full Year 2022 up 44.0% year on year. We reiterate that the company remains committed to its sustainability ambitions by utilizing affordable clean energy in its operations and optimizing its green logistics strategy, however – like its peers – incessant disruptions in gas supply has forced the company to be more reliant on diesel for distribution than it earlier planned.  Our view is that in the medium term, these costs are likely to persist, until a lasting solution to gas supply is found.  FX Revaluation losses pressure earnings The company recorded Net finance costs of N11.84bn in Q4 2022 from a Net finance income of N1.53bn in Q4 21, bringing Net finance costs up 308.6% year on year for Full Year 2022 driven by foreign exchange losses. The company suffered foreign exchange losses of N13.13bn in Full Year 2022, despite having recorded none in Full Year 2021. However, in line with its low Capex spending policy, the company saw borrowing costs fall by 79.6%. Management explained that the worsening exchange rate situation led to revaluation losses, thereby constraining its Net Income growth. Consequently, Profits Before Tax declined by 13.9% year on year in Q4 2022.  It is important to note that for Full Year 2022, the company posted Profit before Tax growth of 12.0% year on year as the chunk of FX losses was suffered during Q4 2022, hence when spread over the course of the year, Full Year 2022 EBIT was sufficient to absorb it.  Despite the lowered tax expense in Q4 2022 down by 22.8% year on year as the tax relief arising from the pioneer tax relief granted to one of its production lines in the Mfamosing Plant expires in Full Year 2022, the company recorded a 17.5% decline in Net Income for Q4 2022.  However, while Full Year 2022 tax expense was up 36.0 year on year, Net Income managed to grow by 5.2% year on year.  Lafarge Africa’s revenue performance in Full Year 2022 was above analyst at Cordros Research expectations soared by 2.7% variance. While its achieved volume output was slightly below our Full Year 2022 forecast by 1.79%, given its focus on capacity utilisation, we note that the company, like its peers, was able to take advantage of elevated prices. Going Into 2023, we believe the company is positioned for growth as it ramps up output on the back of the de-bottlenecking exercise strategy.  In the short to medium term, given industry-wide disruption in gas supply, analyst expect the company to continue to rely partly on diesel for production and distribution activities, pressuring bottom line. In addition, following the expiration of its pioneer status, analyst expect its effective tax rate to be restored.
