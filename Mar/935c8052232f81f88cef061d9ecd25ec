Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has directed the Commissioner of Police, Lagos, Idowu Owohunwa, to conduct a full investigation into the Akere fire incident and fish out the perpetrators.

All vulnerable markets must be protected. ”We have received the list of all shop owners affected and we’ll vet the list for compensation to help the victims back on their feet.”
