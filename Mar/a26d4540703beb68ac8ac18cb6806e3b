The gubernatorial candidate of the Social Democratic Party in Ogun State, Tony Ojeshina, has withdrawn from the race. Ojeshina said he was stepping down to team up with his counterpart from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Ladi Adebutu. Ojeshina told newsmen in Abeokuta on Thursday that Adebutu’s vision for a better Ogun State is in tandem with his manifestoes in terms of securing a better future for the State. “Our great party has agreed to work with PDP during the gubernatorial election of March 18, 2023,” said Ojeshina. The SDP candidate maintained that the synergy between SDP and PDP would usher in a prosperous time for Ogun people. “I hereby step down from the gubernatorial race to support the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Oladidpupo Adebutu, as the governor of the state,” he declared, while directing all his supporters and members of the SDP to vote for the PDP on March 18. However, he said the SDP House of Assembly candidates are still in the race. In his words, the Deputy Chairman of the SDP in Ogun, Shola Coker, corroborated that the State Working Committee of the party had trust in Adebutu’s candidacy that it would serve the interest of the masses in Ogun State.
