Profit after tax for the period under review rose by eight per cent, moving from N12.93bn in 2021 to N13.93bn in 2022. A breakdown of the results showed that inflation, devaluation of the naira and high energy prices led to a 33 per cent increase in marketing, distribution, and administration expenses (which moved from N123.13bn in 2021 to N163.60bn in 2022) and a 22 per cent  increase in cost of sales (from N276.87 bn in 2021 to N337.31 bn).
