Investigation revealed that the group operated within and around Plateau, Nasarawa, Bauchi and Gombe states. The statement added, “Members of the second syndicate arrested with the exhibits of $64,800 and N475,000 are Jonathan Dakogol, Abbas Ibrahim, Isa Ukashatu and Aminu Isa. “Isa Ukashatu and Jonathan Dakogol were arrested with fake $64,800 and N475,000 at Akurba of Lafia LGA, in Nasarawa State after being lured to deliver the money to a client.” The NSCDC Commandant General, Ahmed Audi, described the criminal gangs as economic saboteurs destroying the country through the perpetration of financial crimes and defrauding innocent citizens.
