The National Industrial Court has ordered the Kwara State University to pay its dismissed employee his three months’ salary in lieu of notice of the termination of his appointment. The court, in addition, ordered the defendant to calculate, pay the three months salary within 21 days and awarded the sum of N200,000 as cost in favour of the claimant. The judge, Justice Kiyersohot Damulak, while delivering judgment, however, dismissed the allegation of wrongful employment termination filed by the claimant, Dr David Atanda, against the defendant, for lacking merit. Atanda submitted that his appointment with the university was for a three-year probationary period. He further averred that he faced a disciplinary committee on alleged misconduct after which his appointment was terminated on October 10, 2016. In defence, the defendant averred that by section 16 of the Kwara State Law, 2008, (Kwara State University Law, 2008), the university could investigate and punish any of its erring staff. The court concluded by making an order for the University to calculate and pay Atanda three months’ salary in lieu of notice within 21 days.
