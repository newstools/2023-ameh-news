The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps in Rivers State has said its operatives uncovered an illegal local refinery at Otamiri-Etche in the Etche Local Government Area of the state. The corps said the discovery was made possible following the sustained intelligence of its operatives. The Commandant, NSCDC, Rivers State Command, Michael Ogar, disclosed this while speaking with newsmen in Port Harcourt on Thursday. Ogar stated, “I must confess that this is the first time of witnessing a well fabricated illegal refinery with such a wide range of pipes laid across the area. “We were able to uncover this illegal bunkering site based on sustained intelligence. The perpetrators tapped into Heirs Holding Oil and Gas facility through the pipeline bulk delivery and siphoned crude oil through carefully constructed pipes to their illegal local refinery. “We have commenced intense investigation into the matter, someone must have given out this expanse of land to the bunkerers.” He said the NSCDC had a clear mandate to safeguard critical national assets and infrastructure across the federation, stating, “Without compromise, we will go after them and ensure that the illegal dealings in petroleum products is reduced drastically in order to boost the nation’s economy again.” Ogar warned those still engaging in oil theft and operators of local refineries in the state to relocate or face the full wrath of the law.
