President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday congratulated Xi Jinping on his re-election for a third 5-year term as President and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the People’s Republic of China. This was contained in a statement by Buhari’s spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, in Abuja. According to Buhari, under the leadership of President Xi, relations between Nigeria and China, which dates back to 1971 when both nations formally established diplomatic ties, have expanded rapidly on strategic cooperation and bilateral trade. The Nigerian leader, therefore, expressed the hope that the future outlook of the strategic partnership with China would continue to blossom in bounds and leaps in the areas of military, trade, political, oil and gas and finance relations. Buhari also expressed the belief that such a partnership would include cooperation in the telecommunications, agriculture, infrastructure development, and manufacturing sectors. The President wished the government and people of China continued peace, progress, and prosperity under the able and trusted leadership of President Xi.
