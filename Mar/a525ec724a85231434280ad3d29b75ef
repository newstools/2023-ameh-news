The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said the General Overseer of the  Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, is a blessing to the state. He also described the clergyman as an epitome of honesty, dedication and service, whose unblemished records of work in God’s kingdom over the decades had made him a role model. Sanwo-Olu said this while congratulating Adeboye on the occasion of his 81st birthday. This was disclosed in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Gboyega Akosile, on Wednesday. “Sir, you have been a blessing, not just to the Redeemed Christian Church of God but also to us in Lagos State. “Your unceasing prayers for us and wise counsel over the years have contributed in no small measure to the phenomenal progress our state has continued to witness. We will forever be grateful,” Sanwo-Olu was quoted as saying. The governor then hailed Adeboye for building one of the largest spiritual institutions in the world and raising millions of committed followers of Jesus Christ. He said, “Daddy GO, as Adeboye is popularly called, is one of the respected global evangelists who has contributed immensely to the propagation of the gospel at national and international levels, without any blemish or scandal. “Because of your work, and of the name and legacy of the RCCG, the gospel has touched the very ends of the earth, in line with the Great Commission. “In addition, your devoted service in God’s vineyard has helped put Nigeria in the global spotlight as a land of spiritual exploits and greatness.”
