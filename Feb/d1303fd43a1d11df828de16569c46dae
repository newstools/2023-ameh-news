The Ebonyi State government on Monday ordered the closure of schools from February 22 to March 13 to enable students and other eligible voters to vote in the 2023 general elections. Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Uchenna Orji, told newsmen that the decision was the outcome of the State’s Executive Council meeting on Monday. Orji said the council arrived at the decision having considered a memorandum presented by the commissioner for education requesting it to declare public holidays during the elections. “Council noted the reason behind the considerations sought, especially the security considerations and the sensitivity of the elections. “It approved the request and directed that for the sake of students’ civic rights and security considerations, all public and private primary and secondary schools shall observe the public holidays. “This is effective from February 22 to March 13. “Schools academic session would be extended by three weeks to cover the lost academic period,’’ he said.
