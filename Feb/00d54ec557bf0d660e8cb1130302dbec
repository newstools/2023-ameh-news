Famous Nigerian social critic, Aisha Yesufu, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to display the complete election results on its portal so that Nigerians can manually collate results. only 30 percent results of the election which was held on Saturday has so far been uploaded. Some of the results on the IReV were also uploaded in low quality. Reacting, Aisha on Twitter wrote, ”INEC should display the results, polling unit by polling unit. This is what was to be displayed by IReV. ”Do not give us a lumped result. Citizens were supposed to verify their polling units results via IReV. ”So let’s do it manually at the collation centre.”
