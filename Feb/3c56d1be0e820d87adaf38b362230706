Former Vice President, Namadi Sambo, former Kaduna governors Ahmed Makarfi and Ramalan Yero, have vowed to bring back the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to power in Kaduna State. They vowed to do everything legitimately possible to unseat the All Progressives Congress, APC. Speaking at the official flag-off and presentation of flags to candidates of the PDP for the Kaduna Central Senatorial District for the various positions, on Monday, they vowed to work assiduously towards ensuring the success of the party. The Senatorial candidate of the party for Kaduna Central, Lawal Adamu, who recently triumphed at the Supreme Court, was officially handed over the flag of the PDP as its candidate. Sambo, who was the special guest of honour at the flag-off, called on Nigerians and the good people of Kaduna State to come out en masse to vote for all the PDP candidates in the elections in order to liberate the state from the present challenges it was going through. Former governor Makarfi called on all the PDP members to unite, go back to their respective polling units and deliver the party’s candidates in the polls come Saturday for the presidential and National Assembly elections, as well as the governorship and state House of Assembly elections. Makarfi assured, “We the former governors of the state will guide the governorship candidate of the party when voted accordingly towards ensuring that the entire state is carried along in every ramifications.” Ex-governor Ramalan Yero enjoined all party members in the state to work as a family and ensure victory in all the elections, stressing that they should conduct themselves in an orderly and peaceful manner. Senator Shehu Sani and Senator Sani Bello, in their goodwill messages, called on residents of the state and Nigerians to vote out the ruling party, APC, pointing out that the present suffering would be a thing of the past and usher in a new beginning to all Nigerians.
