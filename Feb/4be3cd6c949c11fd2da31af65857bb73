The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Kaduna State has condemned the government’s free food, free transport and medical services for residents of the state. The state PDP considered the measures taken by the state government as purely vote-buying ahead of the 2023 general election in a state where the citizens have suffered in the hands of the APC-led government. The state government, had announced the provision of free transport services, free medical care for common illnesses like malaria and typhoid, as well as food to alleviate the effect of the current scarcity of cash being faced by the people of the state. Alhaji Ibrahim Wusono, the state secretary of the PDP noted that the state government brought a plan by transporting people from Kaduna to Zaria metropolis free of charge, while drawing the attention of Kaduna citizens that it was part of the deceit which has always been part of the APC government for the past seven years. According to him, “People should understand or remember that it’s the APC government that sacked more than 62,000 workers including teachers in the state.” He added “it is the same APC government in the state that demolished houses, market stalls”, stressing that “it is under the APC administration that people are not secured, with many killed, kidnapped, with millions of naira given as ransoms.” He explained that what was happening in Birnin-Gwari, Giwa, Chikun, Kajuru and Southern Kaduna was as a result of the poor leadership of the APC government. The Secretary appealed to the people of Kaduna to resist the tactics being introduced by the APC government. The PDP scribe denied any rift in the party in the state, as according to him, all the party stalwarts were now united and determined more than ever to unseat the APC government.
