The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, said on Tuesday that industrial action by university lecturers, under the aegis of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, will be a thing of the past if he emerges Nigeria’s President. Tinubu also promised to build on the developmental programmes of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.). He said  Buhari’s eight-year reign was a retooling process, adding that he would invest in education, build infrastructure and be prudent, should he be elected as the next president. Tinubu made the pledge during his presidential campaign at the Dan Anyiam Stadium, Owerri, the Imo State capital. He said, “There will no longer be ASUU strike in Nigeria. All courses will be finished as and when due. For instance, all courses slated for four years will be finished at the end of the four years in the university.” Berating the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, Tinubu said, “The PDP stole Nigeria’s treasure. President Buhari’s eight years is a retooling process. The PDP are liars. We will continue with developmental programmes of the APC, it will not stop. Imo is the destination for tourism, we will add value to real estate in Imo State, invest in education, build and reconstruct your roads in Imo. No more issue of ASUU strike. We will be prudent and manage revenue generation capacity, we will bring peace, we will work with the state to ensure security.” In  his speech, the Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodimma, said that the state was APC-inclined and assured Tinubu that the people would not disappoint him and the party.
