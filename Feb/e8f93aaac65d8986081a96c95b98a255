Over 40 anti-corruption civil society organisations have asked the president, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to sack the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Abdulrasheed Bawa, for “incessant disobedience of court orders.” This was as they noted that the commission has derailed from its mission and was now politicised. In a press conference held in Lagos in protest of Bawa’s attitude, the CSOs led by the Chairman of the Centre for Anti-corruption and Open Leadership, Mr Debo Adeniran, said Bawa had made the EFCC an “institution known for brazenly disobeying court orders in such a manner that does not only undermine the institutions of Nigeria’s democracy but also indicates a contradiction to the anti-corruption agenda of Buhari.” They, therefore, concluded that Bawa must be sacked in order for the commission to “recover its past glory”.
