The gubernatorial candidate of the main opposition Party, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Ebonyi State, Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odii has decried the level of conflicts in various communities in the thirteen (13) local government areas of the state. Odii made this known while speaking with newsmen shortly after his visit to religious leaders of the various churches in Ebonyi, the capital of the state. He urged the religious leaders to remain committed and pray for peaceful and credible elections, and vowed to restore peace and order in the state if he emerges winner. Odii expressed disappointment on the continued conflicts of various degrees that have rocked communities in the 13 local government areas of the state. He said: “virtually every local government area in Ebonyi State is experiencing one induced conflict or another presently”. He vowed to end such attacks if he emerged winner in the March 11, 2023, guber election in the state. “This current situation in Ebonyi can’t be allowed to continue as it is not good for the progress of the state,” he stated. He noted that his government will “prioritize peace building and uniting all sections of the state because there cannot be any meaningful progress when a state is divided along various ethnic or religious lines.” Earlier in a remark, the leader of the Christ Ascension Church, CAC, in Ebonyi State, Bishop Chinedu Nwoye, who spoke on behalf of other clergymen, said that “we are currently threatened in Ebonyi because we have politicians that are threatening the peace of the land, and if such politicians win, it means that the church may become unstable.”
