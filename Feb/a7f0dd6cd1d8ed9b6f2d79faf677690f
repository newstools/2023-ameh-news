Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has said the Integrity group, known as the G5 governors of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is not dead. This was as Wike said the G5 governors would not reveal their strategy ahead of the forthcoming elections starting on February 25. He spoke while reacting to a claim by the Chairperson of the PDP presidential campaign in the State, Lee Maeba that the G5 was dead. The G5 group comprises Wike, Samuel Ortom of Benue, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu, Seyi Makinde of Oyo, and Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia. However, speaking on Tuesday at a campaign flag-off rally organised by the Rivers PDP campaign council for Ahoada East LGA, Wike said the group has withdrawn from speaking regularly in public, to strategise. A statement by Wike’s Media Aide, Kelvin Ebiri, said: “You people say G5 is dead. We that you said are dead are not worried, but you that are alive are worried. “We are not talking again; we are not worried. Yet you are worried. You fail to realise that in politics, there is time for talking and time for action. Action has started and 25th February is the D-day. “You can never know what our plans and strategies are. No matter how you people pressurise us, we will not disclose our strategy. The more you look, the less you see.”
