National Christian Elders Forum, NCEF, has endorsed the candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi to win Nigeria’s presidential election. The group of Christian elder statesmen across the country, including former Army chief, retired General T. Y. Danjuma made the announcement on Tuesday. The eminent citizens urged security agencies not to take the reports that some regions were preparing to unleash violence lightly. The NCEF called on Nigerians to vote candidates based on capacity, ability, integrity, and good health, noting that “a sick country requires healthy leaders”. The statement endorsing Obi, titled “Resolutions towards 2023 elections: Think new”, was signed by Forum Chairman, Dr. Samuel Gani and the Secretary, Pastor Bosun Emmanuel. The body cited the need to ensure democracy survives and the eradication of the culture of corruption, incompetency, lawlessness, and impunity in the past 24 years. “The National Christian Elders Forum is endorsing Mr. Peter Obi of the Labour Party as the Presidential candidate to be voted for,” the leaders said. The leaders stressed that Nigeria requires new leaders, new methods, new policies, new parties, and hailed the Federal Government for taking steps to curb vote-buying. Noting that the policy of currency change has brought some inconvenience to citizens, the forum said the long-term benefit would be appreciated. Members include Dr. Ayo Abifarin, Gen. Zamani Lekwot (retd), Hon. Justice James Ogebe (retd), Elder Moses Ihonde, Dr. Saleh Hussaini, Vice Chairman (North), Elder Shyngle Wigwe, Vice Chairman (South). Others are Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife, Dame Priscilla Kuye, Prof. Deborah Ajakaiye, His Royal Majesty Oba Dokun Thompson, Dr. Taiwo Idemudia, Hon. Justice Kalajine Anigbogu (retd.), Elder Nat Okoro, Solomon Asemota (SAN), Elder Matthew Owojaiye, DIG P. L. Dabup.
