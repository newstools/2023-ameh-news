He further disclosed that “the number of candidates, who scored five Credits and above, including English Language and Mathematics, was 33,914, representing 57.36 per cent. “Also, 46,825 candidates, representing 79.20 pet cent got five Credits and above irrespective of English Language and Mathematics,” he said. Speaking on the issue of examination malpractices, Wushishi said, “11, 419 candidates were booked for various forms of malpractices, as against the 4,454 in 2021; which shows a sharp rise in the number of malpractice cases”. According to him, this was largely due to the improvement in the strategy and technique adopted by the monitoring officers, which “led to the blacklisting of four supervisors, one each from Rivers and Plateau states and two from Ogun State for aiding and abetting, as well as poor supervision.”
