Gunmen, on Tuesday, kidnapped 15 members of the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, in Anambra State. The corps members were abducted by the hoodlums at a filling station in Ihiala Local Government Area of the State. It was gathered that the corps members had just completed their three-week orientation programme in Imo State, and were travelling to Lagos when they were abducted. “The gunmen hijacked their vehicle and diverted it to Isseke, Ihiala-Orlu expressway where they kept them (corps members) hostage,” a source said. Reacting to the incident, the Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Tochukwu Ikenga, however, said the corps members have been released through the efforts of police operatives. He said, “Anambra State Police Operatives, by 11:15 am today (Tuesday) 14/2/2023, responding to a distress call along Isseke, Ihiala road, rescued unhurt 15 abducted Corps members from NYSC Orientation Camp, Eziama-Obaire, Nkwerre, LGA, Imo State. “Information reveals that the Corps members finished their three weeks of orientation programs today (Tuesday) and were en route to Lagos before their vehicle was intercepted at total junction Ihiala by yet-to-be-identified armed men in unmarked white Toyota Hilux. “Their (corps members) vehicle was diverted to Isseke, Ihiala-Orlu expressway where the gunmen kept them hostage.
