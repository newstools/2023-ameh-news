The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has suspended two registration centres for collecting N6,500 from candidates for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination e-form PIN instead of the authorised N5,700. Speaking on Tuesday at the JKK Computer-Based-Test Centre, Ilupeju, Lagos, while monitoring the registration process across Lagos, Registrar, JAMB, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, called for the immediate blockage of access and activities of the Parkway Project and Digital Partners on the JAMB portal for extorting candidates. He added that another JAMB agent, E-Transact, was also on suspension for not complying with the rules and regulations of the board. “Every agent was paid 5% of the whole money. The money was collected by JAMB, and every Friday, we pay them for the week. We’ve already paid over N300 million in commissions, so there’s no need to extort candidates. They are our agents. E-Transact is on suspension too,” he said. Oloyede also emphasised that the registration time would not be extended beyond February 12, 2023, saying that the board expected registration of 100,000 per day, but just recently, it had been within 62,000 per day. Recall that JAMB announced the closure of some substandard CBT centres, which reduced the number of CBT centres across the country.
