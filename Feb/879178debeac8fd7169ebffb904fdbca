All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential Campaign Council on Sunday said it had noticed the disingenuous attempts by the spokesmen of the opposition parties (PDP and LP) campaign councils and their hired talking heads on Television Stations to discredit the Presidential and National Assembly elections conducted nationwide over the weekend. In a statement by Bayo Onanuga, Director, Media & Publicity, APC Presidential Campaign Council warned the PDP and LP to allow the INEC to perform its duties, adding that any attempt to discredit the polls would fail. The statement read in part, “Two persons we consider as respectable citizens, Prof. Pat Utomi and Director-General of Peter Obi Campaign Council, Akin Osuntokun, threw caution to the wind by their inciting and incendiary comments on social media and TV stations. “Both Labour Party and PDP have accused INEC of conspiracy to rig election results in favour of our party (APC), anchoring their allegation on the agency’s inability to upload election results on its website. “This brazen attempt to discredit this election will fail.” DAILY POST reports that the Presidential and National Assembly elections were conducted over the weekend across the country.
