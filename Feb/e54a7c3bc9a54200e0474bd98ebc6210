There was tension at the Gombe Lawanti International Airport when an Airpeace plane carrying passengers from Abuja almost crash-landed. This happened as the control tower suddenly stopped working when the plane made to land. A source and a passenger told DAILY POST that the manager went into hiding immediately after the tower stopped working, leaving passengers waiting at the departure lounge in deep confusion. The plane which was originally meant to take off to Abuja upon arriving at the airport at 7.15 pm, was only seen attempting to land around 10pm. Addressing the passengers, the Air Peace manager said the issue was due to the failure of some of the equipment, saying that everyone saw when the plane made several attempts to land but couldn’t. He said, ” We couldn’t risk the life of the people by forcing the plane to land as some of the airport equipment suddenly stopped working.” When passengers asked him about the next line of action, he retorted, ” you have a choice to wait for a decision or you can go.” This infuriated many of the passengers who are now stranded at the airport, worrying for their safety and those of their properties.
