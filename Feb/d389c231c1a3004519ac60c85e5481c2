Tension is high in Taraba State as members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, await Supreme Court judgement on the party’s guber candidate. This is coming a few days after the same court nullified the governorship primary election conducted by the All Progressives Congress, APC. One of the PDP governorship aspirants, Professor Jerome Nyameh had approached the apex court after the Appeal Court voided his suit against the PDP gubernatorial candidate, Kefas Agbu, on the grounds that he (Agbu) did not purchase the expression of interest and nomination forms. He argued through his counsel, Pius D. Pius that the candidate was the party’s State chairman, whom he said presided over the screening of some aspirants jostling for various elective positions on the platform of the party. At the time of filing this report, palpable tension has enveloped the camps of both Agbu and Nyameh. Some of their supporters,said they would accept the outcome of the judgement in good faith.
