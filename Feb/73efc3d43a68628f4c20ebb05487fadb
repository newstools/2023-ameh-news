According to the commission, this will enable and members of the public across the country to report any issues that may affect them, or others, during the elections on Saturday, February 25, 2023. It stated that this is to support the Independent National Electoral Commission, towards the conduct of hitch-free elections in Nigeria. It added the toll-free number was launched in view of resolving any issues as complaints will be conveyed to relevant agencies, authorities, or organisations for timely resolution and will be open to the public from 8.00 am to 6.00 pm on election day. In a statement signed by the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, NCC, Professor Umar Danbatta, the commission said, “The Toll-Free Number 622 is the second-level complaints centre through which consumers of telecommunications services are allowed to make calls directly to the Commission, to resolve issues concerning their telecommunications services which the service providers are unable to do. “However, in consideration of the critical nature of this election and to alleviate emergent issues that may arise at the voting centres, or any parts of Nigeria thereof, the Commission has considered it expedient to dedicate the Toll-Free Number 622 to accommodate all types of complaints on election day.”
