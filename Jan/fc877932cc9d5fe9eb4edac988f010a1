The Bayelsa State Government has faulted the current monetary policies of the Central Bank of Nigeria’s policy on daily cash withdrawal limits. While expressing concern that the policy would not favour predominantly rural states, including Bayelsa, because of the absence of banking services in the rural areas, it urged the CBN to reverse the policy. The State Deputy Governor, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, stated these while speaking with journalists after attending the 2023 New Year Day mass at Saint Paul’s Catholic Parish, Ofoni, in the Sagbama Local Government Area of the state on Sunday. He also called on the Federal Government and the Independent National Electoral Commission to do everything within their powers to ensure that the general elections in the country this year were free, fair, credible and equitable. Ewhrudjakpo in a statement by his media aide, Doubara Atasi, however, sent his New Year greetings to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, and the people of the state. According to him, 2023 has a positive outlook with great opportunities for the state despite the challenges facing the country. He pointed out that for such opportunities to become a reality, Nigerians, especially those placed in authority, should strive to abide by the rules governing the conduct of public affairs. He said, “First of all, we want to thank God for guiding us through 2022; a very turbulent year, but God saw us through. And now we are in 2023 by His grace and mercy. “2023 is a year with a lot of possibilities. It is an election year and we believe that the Federal Government and the electoral umpire will do all that is necessary for us to have a free, fair, credible and equitable election.
