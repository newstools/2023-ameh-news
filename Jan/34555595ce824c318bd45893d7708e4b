Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has warned that the current scarcity of the new naira notes is a threat to national security. There is existing severe scarcity of newly introduced Naira notes in most banks across Nigeria. According to HURIWA, the inefficiency of the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, is a pointer to why Nigeria needs an independent Governor of the apex bank. The group believes the current system of the bank leadership is politically tainted and compromised. HURIWA said it believes that there is more Nigerians need to know about the haste with which the redesigning project of the naira was handled by the Governor of the CBN and President Muhammadu Buhari. The rights advocacy group wondered how the CBN boss carried out such a monumental financial initiative at the same time he was being chased about by the Department of State Services and also facing a court Case in the USA. The group, in a statement signed by its national Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, said it observed the organised chaos and rancorous situation over the lack of the new Naira notes and the attendant hardships experienced by millions of commoners across the country. The group called on Buhari to do the needful to check the internal saboteurs within the banking system that are hijacking the new notes from the CBN and selling them to politicians and the rich. HURIWA berated the apex bank boss for allegedly turning the office of the CBN Governor into that of a senior errand boy of the President.
