The All Progressives Congress, APC, on Monday ended the presidential campaign rally in Bauchi State at the Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Stadium abruptly after the microphone on the podium ceased working. The Party’s National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, who was supposed to usher President Muhammadu Buhari and the party’s presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to the podium, had barely started making his remarks when the microphone malfunctioned. It was reported that President Buhari merely walked to the stage and presented the party’s flag to the APC governorship candidate in the State, Air Marshal Sadique Baba Abubakar (rtd), after the frantic efforts of the engineers operating the electrical equipment of the event were futile. The President’s security immediately ferried him out of the stadium without making any speech after the presentation of the flag. Similarly, the presidential candidate, Tinubu and his running mate, Kashim Shettima, left the venue without uttering a word to the crowd of party members and supporters after the development caused a commotion at the venue.
