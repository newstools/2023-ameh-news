The Nigerian Exchange Ltd closed negative due to buy-interests and sell-offs in large and small capitalised stocks. Also, the market capitalisation dropped by N52 billion to close at N28.681 trillion as against N28.733 trillion posted at the previous trading.

The market breadth closed positive with 24 gainers and seven losers. Analysts at Vetiva Securities Ltd. said, “As expected, there was negative reaction to Guinness latest numbers, where Profit After Tax (PAT) declined by 54 per cent in its H1’23 period. “Hence, the 3.71 per cent decline in the stock’s share price. However, we did see investors buy up Tier-1 banks – Zenith and GTCO, while cross trades done at lower price levels in MTNN dampened market sentiment. “We expect to see improvement in market performance at the start of the week, amid a positive market breadth.” Cutix  led the losers’ chart in percentage terms by 8.11 per cent to close at N2.40, per share.
