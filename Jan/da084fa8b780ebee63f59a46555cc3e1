According to the CBN report, the MPC noted that broad money supply (M3) grew further by 13.80 per cent in October 2022, (year-to-date) compared with 11.00 per cent in September, 2022. This growth was driven by increased claims on ‘other sectors’ (other financial corporations, public non-financial corporations, and private sector). In the financial markets, money market rates oscillated below and within the asymmetric corridor of the discount window facilities, in tandem with fluctuating liquidity conditions in the banking system. Consequently, the monthly weighted average Open Buy Back rate increased to 15.91 per cent in October 2022 from 11.49 per cent in September 2022. The Capital Adequacy Ratio of the banking system declined in October 2022 to 13.4 but remained within its prudential limit of 10.0 -15.0 per cent. At 40.1 per cent, the liquidity ratio was above its prudential limit of 30.0 per cent. The non-performing loans ratio also improved to 4.8 per cent in October 2022 from 4.9 per cent in the previous month, staying below its prudential benchmark of 5.0 per cent.
