 The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited on Thursday said it was false to claim that the oil firm exported 17.88 million barrels of crude oil without proper documentation NNPC’s Chief Corporate Communications Officer, Garba-Deen Muhammad, said the public should disregard the claims, as reported by a section of the media. In a series of tweets by the oil company and signed by Muhammad, the firm said, “Our attention has been drawn to an online publication, alleging that NNPC exported 17.877 million barrels of crude oil without proper documentation in four years (2016 to 2020). “The Auditor-General’s report in reference did mention 32 oil marketing companies involved in the non-completion of the NXP forms, but that does not in any way mean that the proceeds from the sale of the said crude were not repatriated into the coffers of NNPC and consequently into the Federation Accounts for Federation related barrels.” The company added, “It should also be noted that NNPC does not appoint Inspection agents as alleged, but rather, it is the sole responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Finance. “Therefore, the general public is advised to disregard the said malicious publication, and instead, visit the relevant Auditor-General’s website to see the full content of the audit report, and be guided accordingly.”
