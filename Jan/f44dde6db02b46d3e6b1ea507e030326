Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has pledged to support the families of slain officers and men of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps. Seven personnel of the corps were ambushed and killed alongside five others from a sister security agency and local security service on January 9, 2023. The personnel who were attached to the Kaduna State Ministry of Mines were ambushed and killed by bandits while on official duty at a mining site in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State. El-Rufai made the pledge when he played host to the Commandant General of NSCDC, Ahmed Audi, where he condoled with the CG on the deaths of the gallant men who died in active service. In a statement signed by the corps spokesperson, Olusola Odumosu, on Sunday, the support would help cushion the effects of the hardship that the loss of their breadwinners may have created. El-Rufai sympathised with the loved ones left behind and the NSCDC family, promising continuous support in terms of logistics, operational equipment, and working tools to improve its operational services. The governor expressed satisfaction with the performance of the corps, especially in the protection of critical assets and infrastructure in the state, citing the mining sector as significant to the growth of the nationâ€™s economy.
