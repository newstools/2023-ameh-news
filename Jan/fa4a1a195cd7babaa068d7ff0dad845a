The Federal Ministry of Labour has reacted to allegations that it rejected the four-year audit report of the Academic Staff Union of Universities. The spokesperson for the labour ministry, Olajide Oshundun,told our correspondent in an exclusive chat on Friday, that the the audit report was not received because ASUU shunned a letter by the ministry demanding explanations on why the report was not submitted at the appropriate time. The Federal Government had withheld the November 2022 check-off dues of ASUU members, despite the payment of pro-rata salaries for the month of November 2022. The labour ministryâ€™s spokesperson, who confirmed the development, noted that the decision to withhold the check-off dues was as a result of the failure of ASUU to make available to the ministry its audit report.
