The ban on Okada and Keke NAPEP operators between 6a.m. and 9p.m. by the Kwara State police command is still in force. This was confirmed by the Kwara State Police Command stated in a statement issued by the Police Public Relations Officer, Okasanmi Ajayi, in Ilorin on Tuesday. He said the command “reminds motorcycle and Keke NAPEP operators of the illegality of operating between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. in Kwara State.” According to Okasanmi, “This reminder is imperative in light of the wrong assumption by some political party supporters that the enforcement of the order banning the movement of Okada and Keke NAPEP operators is targeting Okada riders who were loyal to their party; this assumption is false and without basis. “No union leader was arrested by the police for supporting any political party, if there was any arrest, the arrested person definitely must have committed an offense.” He said the police command is apolitical and non-partisan and has been discharging its duties conscientiously without fear or favour. The State Commissioner of Police, Paul Odama advised supporters of political parties to eschew heating up the polity and stand by the truth at all times.
