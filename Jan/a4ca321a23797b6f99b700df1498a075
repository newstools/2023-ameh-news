The Kwara State police command, on Thursday, confirmed the release of four tipper drivers who were reportedly kidnapped on Wednesday in the outskirts of Ilorin, the State capital. Spokesman of the police command, Mr Okasanmi Ajayi informed on Thursday that the four kidnap victims have regained their freedom from the kidnappersâ€™ den and are now with their families. The police spokesman disclosed that efforts were ongoing to arrest masterminds of the kidnap incident. Although a family source of one of the released drivers revealed that ransom was paid for their freedom, the police command remained silent on the issue because of its zero tolerance for ransom payment by families of abducted victims. Okasanmi, appealed to members of the public to continue to give the police information which will make them succeed in their assignment. Reports said the four tipper drivers were ambushed and taken away by some men on military Uniform at a site where they had gone to collect sand. The four victims were said to be members of the Oyun garage branch of the Association of Quarry and Sand dealers, Ilorin. The kidnappers, who later contacted their families, demanded N5m ransom from each of the affected families. The tipper drivers were seen on old Jebba-Ilorin Road, precisely around the Kwara State Polytechnic axis on Wednesday, before the incident.
