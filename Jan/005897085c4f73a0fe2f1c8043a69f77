The troll between the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar and that of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu may not go down soon as each party uses every given opportunity to throw jabs at the other. During the APC presidential campaign rally held on Monday at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium Uyo, its presidential candidate, Tinubu urged the people to collect their Permanent Voters cards and vote APC to usher in a new era of prosperity, infrastructural renaissance and human capital developments. Tinubu noted that if the people make the mistake of giving power to the PDP, its candidate could “sell your palm trees and run to Dubai.” He encouraged the people to arm themselves with their PVCs and be part of the sweeping revolution, assuring that he would end insecurity, fuel crisis and create an enabling environment for socio-economic activities to thrive in the country. He said: “The power to become President resides in you. ‘Emilokan’ (this is my turn) and God will give you the power to make it realizable through your PVCs. So, if you don’t have it, go and get it because if God blesses me as your next President, you will be put in proper places. But, If you give him (Atiku) a chance, he will sell your palm trees and run to Dubai.” He also described the former Vice President as a man that cannot be trusted, recalling that when he was the Vice President to Olusegun Obasanjo, he (Atiku) engaged in wanton sleazy deals and selling off of some national assets, which he turned out to be the single beneficiary. The Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Obong Umana Okon Umana, the Vice Chairman of the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), Chief Godswill Akpabio, the Chairman of the rally organizing committee, Obong Nsima Ekere, member of the APC Board of the (BoT), Atuekong Don Etiebet, all assured Tinubu of delivering the State and the South-South to the APC at the polls.
