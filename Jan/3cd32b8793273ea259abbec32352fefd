The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has stressed the need for citizens to pray for a peaceful transition as the general elections approach. He also urged residents to disregard evil predictions of anarchy and violence peddled every election season by fake prophets and enemies of the country. The governor made the appeal on Sunday in his address during the state’s 23rd annual New Year thanksgiving service, themed, ‘Praising the name of God,’ held at the Tafawa Balewa Square on Lagos Island. Sanwo-Olu said, “This is the first time this event is holding outside the Government House. We decided to hold this year’s thanksgiving at this venue to allow a greater number of people to participate, in line with our administration’s policy of inclusion. “Secondly, this year’s thanksgiving is also significant because this is a general election year for Nigeria. Part of our supplications to God today is for us to witness another smooth and peaceful transition of government; a transition that will defy the evil predictions of anarchy and violence peddled every election season by false prophets and enemies of our dear land.” The state Commissioner for Home Affairs, Mr Anofiu Elegushi, said all the promises made by the Sanwo-Olu’s administration in line with the THEMES agenda have received attention in the last four years.
