Health union in Yariman Bakura Specialist Hospital, Gusau, Zamfara State capital has embarked on a peaceful protest over non-payment of workers’ salaries. that the union had earlier issued a one-week ultimatum to the Zamfara State Government to clear their members’ salary arrears and correct the half salaries being paid to some of them. The union stated that they contacted relevant authorities over the issue but nothing was done despite several assurances. They said the failure of the relevant authorities to act on their demands within the 24 hours ultimatum earlier issued forced them to stage the peaceful protest. It was gathered that many health workers in the State, apart from Yariman Bakura Specialist Hospital, are also suffering the same non-payment of salaries for months.
