The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria has called on domestic airlines to work together to tackle the issues of delayed flights in the country. The spokesperson FAAN, Hope Faithful-Ivbaze, in a chat with our correspondent in Abuja, said the agency will grant the request of the AON to provide more check-in counters, adding that it is currently automating technical task for seamless facilitation. Recall that the Airline Operators of Nigeria had called on FAAN to provide more check-in counters at the airports to enable seamless travel procedures and reduce the reoccurring issue of delayed flights. Faithful-Ivbaze said, “Yes, of course. We will grant the request because we are expanding and doing automation of the technical task for seamless facilitation, but that should not cause delays because there should be synergy among the airlines to ensure that when they finish check-in and they vacate the space for the next airline to check-in. “So, there should be synergy so that there would be a seamless procedure, that is the reason you have associations,” she said.
